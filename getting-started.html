<h3><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h3>
      
<p>
        To use MyBatis you just need to include the
          <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/releases">mybatis-x.x.x.jar</a>
        file in the classpath.
      </p>
      
<p>
        If you are using Maven just add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
      </p>
        
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.mybatis&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;mybatis&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;x.x.x&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre></div>

<h3><a name="Building_SqlSessionFactory_from_XML"></a>Building SqlSessionFactory from XML</h3>
      
<p>
        Every MyBatis application centers around an instance of
        SqlSessionFactory. A SqlSessionFactory instance can be acquired by
        using the SqlSessionFactoryBuilder. SqlSessionFactoryBuilder can
        build a SqlSessionFactory instance from an XML configuration file,
        or from a custom prepared instance of the Configuration class.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Building a SqlSessionFactory instance from an XML file is very
        simple. It is recommended that you use a classpath resource for
        this configuration, but you could use any InputStream instance,
        including one created from a literal file path or a file:// URL.
        MyBatis includes a utility class, called Resources, that contains
        a number of methods that make it simpler to load resources from
        the classpath and other locations.
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
String resource = &quot;org/mybatis/example/mybatis-config.xml&quot;;
InputStream inputStream = Resources.getResourceAsStream(resource);
SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory =
  new SqlSessionFactoryBuilder().build(inputStream);</pre></div>
      
<p>
        The configuration XML file contains settings for the core of the
        MyBatis system, including a DataSource for acquiring database
        Connection instances, as well as a TransactionManager for
        determining how transactions should be scoped and controlled. The
        full details of the XML configuration file can be found later in
        this document, but here is a simple example:
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE configuration
  PUBLIC &quot;-//mybatis.org//DTD Config 3.0//EN&quot;
  &quot;http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-config.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;environments default=&quot;development&quot;&gt;
    &lt;environment id=&quot;development&quot;&gt;
      &lt;transactionManager type=&quot;JDBC&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;dataSource type=&quot;POOLED&quot;&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;driver&quot; value=&quot;${driver}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;url&quot; value=&quot;${url}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;username&quot; value=&quot;${username}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;password&quot; value=&quot;${password}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/dataSource&gt;
    &lt;/environment&gt;
  &lt;/environments&gt;
  &lt;mappers&gt;
    &lt;mapper resource=&quot;org/mybatis/example/BlogMapper.xml&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/mappers&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre></div>
      
<p>
        While there is a lot more to the XML configuration file, the
        above example points out the most critical parts. Notice the
        XML header, required to validate the XML document. The body
        of the environment element contains the environment
        configuration for transaction management and connection
        pooling. The mappers element contains a list of mappers &#x2013;
        the XML files and/or annotated Java interface classes that
        contain the SQL code and mapping definitions.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
<h3><a name="Building_SqlSessionFactory_without_XML"></a>Building SqlSessionFactory without XML</h3>
      
<p>
        If you prefer to directly build the configuration from Java, rather
        than XML, or create your own configuration builder, MyBatis provides
        a complete Configuration class that provides all of the same
        configuration options as the XML file.
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">DataSource dataSource = BlogDataSourceFactory.getBlogDataSource();
TransactionFactory transactionFactory =
  new JdbcTransactionFactory();
Environment environment =
  new Environment(&quot;development&quot;, transactionFactory, dataSource);
Configuration configuration = new Configuration(environment);
configuration.addMapper(BlogMapper.class);
SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory =
  new SqlSessionFactoryBuilder().build(configuration);</pre></div>
      
<p>
        Notice in this case the configuration is adding a mapper class.
        Mapper classes are Java classes that
        contain SQL Mapping Annotations
        that avoid the need for XML mapping. However, due
        to some limitations of
        Java Annotations and the complexity of some MyBatis mappings, XML
        mapping is still required for the
        most advanced mappings (e.g.
        Nested Join Mapping). For this reason,
        MyBatis will automatically
        look
        for and load a peer XML file if it exists (in this case,
        BlogMapper.xml would be loaded based on the
        classpath and name of
        BlogMapper.class). More on this later.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
<h3><a name="Acquiring_a_SqlSession_from_SqlSessionFactory"></a>Acquiring a SqlSession from SqlSessionFactory</h3>
      
<p>
        Now that you have a SqlSessionFactory, as the name suggests, you
        can acquire an instance of
        SqlSession. The SqlSession contains absolutely every method needed to execute
        SQL commands against
        the database. You can execute mapped SQL statements directly against
        the SqlSession instance. For
        example:
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">try (SqlSession session = sqlSessionFactory.openSession()) {
  Blog blog = session.selectOne(
    &quot;org.mybatis.example.BlogMapper.selectBlog&quot;, 101);
}</pre></div>
      
<p>
        While this approach works, and is familiar to users of previous
        versions of MyBatis, there is now a
        cleaner approach. Using an interface (e.g. BlogMapper.class) that properly
        describes the parameter and
        return value for a given statement, you can now execute cleaner and more
        type safe code, without error
        prone string literals and casting.
      </p>
      
<p>
        For example:
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">try (SqlSession session = sqlSessionFactory.openSession()) {
  BlogMapper mapper = session.getMapper(BlogMapper.class);
  Blog blog = mapper.selectBlog(101);
}</pre></div>
      
<p>
        Now let's explore what exactly is being executed here.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
<h3><a name="Exploring_Mapped_SQL_Statements"></a>Exploring Mapped SQL Statements</h3>
      
<p>
        At this point you may be wondering what exactly is being executed by
        the SqlSession or Mapper class. The topic of Mapped SQL Statements
        is a big one, and that topic will likely dominate the majority of
        this documentation. But to give you an idea of what exactly is being
        run, here are a couple of examples.
      </p>
      
<p>
        In either of the examples above, the statements could have been
        defined by either XML or Annotations. Let's take a look at XML
        first. The full set of features provided by MyBatis can be realized
        by using the XML based mapping language that has made MyBatis
        popular over the years. If you've used MyBatis before, the concept
        will be familiar to you, but there have been numerous improvements
        to the XML mapping documents that will become clear later. Here is
        an example of an XML based mapped statement that would satisfy the
        above SqlSession calls.
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE mapper
  PUBLIC &quot;-//mybatis.org//DTD Mapper 3.0//EN&quot;
  &quot;http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-mapper.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;mapper namespace=&quot;org.mybatis.example.BlogMapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;select id=&quot;selectBlog&quot; resultType=&quot;Blog&quot;&gt;
    select * from Blog where id = #{id}
  &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/mapper&gt;</pre></div>
      
<p>
        While this looks like a lot of overhead for this simple example, it is
        actually very light. You can define as many mapped statements in a
        single mapper XML file as you like, so you get a lot of mileage out
        of the XML header and doctype declaration. The rest of the file is
        pretty self explanatory. It defines a name for the mapped statement
        &#x201c;selectBlog&#x201d;, in the namespace &#x201c;org.mybatis.example.BlogMapper&#x201d;,
        which would allow you to call it by specifying the fully qualified
        name of &#x201c;org.mybatis.example.BlogMapper.selectBlog&#x201d;, as we did above
        in the following example:
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">Blog blog = session.selectOne(
  &quot;org.mybatis.example.BlogMapper.selectBlog&quot;, 101);</pre></div>
      
<p>
        Notice how similar this is to calling a method on a fully qualified Java
        class, and there's a reason for that. This name can be directly
        mapped to a Mapper class of the same name as the namespace, with a
        method that matches the name, parameter, and return type as the
        mapped select statement. This allows you to very simply call the
        method against the Mapper interface as you saw above, but here it is
        again in the following example:
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">BlogMapper mapper = session.getMapper(BlogMapper.class);
Blog blog = mapper.selectBlog(101);</pre></div>
      
<p>
        The second approach has a lot of advantages. First, it doesn't depend
        on a string literal, so it's much safer. Second, if your IDE has
        code completion, you can leverage that when navigating your mapped
        SQL statements.
      </p>
      <hr />
      
<p>
        <span class="label important">NOTE</span>
        <b>A note about namespaces.</b>
      </p>
      
<p>
        <b>Namespaces</b>
        were optional in previous versions of MyBatis, which was confusing
        and unhelpful. Namespaces are now required and have a purpose beyond
        simply isolating statements with longer, fully-qualified names.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Namespaces enable the interface bindings as you see here, and even if you
        don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll use them today, you should follow these practices
        laid out here in case you change your mind. Using the namespace
        once, and putting it in a proper Java package namespace will clean
        up your code and improve the usability of MyBatis in the long term.
      </p>
      
<p>
        <b>Name Resolution:</b> To reduce the amount of typing, MyBatis uses the
        following name resolution rules for all named configuration
        elements, including statements, result maps, caches, etc.
      </p>
      
<ul>
        
<li>Fully qualified names (e.g.
          &#x201c;com.mypackage.MyMapper.selectAllThings&#x201d;) are looked up directly
          and used if found.
        </li>
        
<li>Short names (e.g. &#x201c;selectAllThings&#x201d;) can be used to reference
          any unambiguous entry. However if there are two or more (e.g.
          &#x201c;com.foo.selectAllThings and com.bar.selectAllThings&#x201d;), then you
          will receive an error reporting that the short name is ambiguous
          and therefore must be fully qualified.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      
<p>
        There's one more trick to Mapper classes like BlogMapper. Their mapped
        statements don't need to be mapped with XML at all. Instead they can
        use Java Annotations. For example, the XML above could be eliminated
        and replaced with:
      </p>
      
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">package org.mybatis.example;
public interface BlogMapper {
  @Select(&quot;SELECT * FROM blog WHERE id = #{id}&quot;)
  Blog selectBlog(int id);
}</pre></div>
      
<p>
        The annotations are a lot cleaner for simple statements, however, Java
        Annotations are both limited and messier for more complicated
        statements. Therefore, if you have to do anything complicated,
        you're better off with XML mapped statements.
      </p>
      
<p>
        It will be up to you and your project team to determine which is right
        for you, and how important it is to you that your mapped statements
        be defined in a consistent way. That said, you're never locked into
        a single approach. You can very easily migrate Annotation based
        Mapped Statements to XML and vice versa.

<h3><a name="Scope_and_Lifecycle"></a>Scope and Lifecycle</h3>
      
<p>
        It's very important to understand the various scopes and lifecycles
        classes we've discussed so far. Using them incorrectly can cause
        severe concurrency problems.

        <b>Object lifecycle and Dependency Injection Frameworks</b>
      </p>
      
<p>
        Dependency Injection frameworks can create thread safe, transactional SqlSessions and mappers
        and inject them directly into your beans so you can just forget about their lifecycle.
        You may want to have a look at MyBatis-Spring or
        MyBatis-Guice sub-projects to know more about using MyBatis with DI frameworks.

<h4><a name="SqlSessionFactoryBuilder"></a>SqlSessionFactoryBuilder</h4>
        
<p>
          This class can be instantiated, used and thrown away. There is no need
          to keep it around once you've created your SqlSessionFactory.
          Therefore the best scope for instances of SqlSessionFactoryBuilder
          is method scope (i.e. a local method variable). You can reuse the
          SqlSessionFactoryBuilder to build multiple SqlSessionFactory
          instances, but it's still best not to keep it around to ensure that
          all of the XML parsing resources are freed up for more important
          things.
        </p>
      </section><section>
<h4><a name="SqlSessionFactory"></a>SqlSessionFactory</h4>
        
<p>
          Once created, the SqlSessionFactory should exist for the duration of
          your application execution. There should be little or no reason to
          ever dispose of it or recreate it. It's a best practice to not
          rebuild the SqlSessionFactory multiple times in an application run.
          Doing so should be considered a &#x201c;bad smell&#x201d;. Therefore the best
          scope of SqlSessionFactory is application scope. This can be
          achieved a number of ways. The simplest is to use a Singleton
          pattern or Static Singleton pattern.
        </p>
      </section><section>
<h4><a name="SqlSession"></a>SqlSession</h4>
        
<p>
          Each thread should have its own instance of SqlSession. Instances of
          SqlSession are not to be shared and are not thread safe. Therefore
          the best scope is request or method scope. Never keep references to
          a SqlSession instance in a static field or even an instance field
          of a class. Never keep references to a SqlSession in any sort of
          managed scope, such as HttpSession of the Servlet framework. If
          you're using a web framework of any sort, consider the SqlSession
          to follow a similar scope to that of an HTTP request. In other
          words, upon receiving an HTTP request, you can open a SqlSession,
          then upon returning the response, you can close it. Closing the
          session is very important. You should always ensure that it's
          closed within a finally block. The following is the standard
          pattern for ensuring that SqlSessions are closed:
        </p>
        
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">try (SqlSession session = sqlSessionFactory.openSession()) {
  // do work
}</pre></div>
        
<p>
          Using this pattern consistently throughout your code will ensure that
          all database resources are properly closed.
        </p>
      </section><section>
<h4><a name="Mapper_Instances"></a>Mapper Instances</h4>
        
<p>
          Mappers are interfaces that you create to bind to your mapped statements.
          Instances of the mapper interfaces are acquired from the
          SqlSession. As such, technically the broadest scope of any mapper
          instance is the same as the SqlSession from which they were
          requested. However, the best scope for mapper instances is method
          scope. That is, they should be requested within the method that
          they are used, and then be discarded. They do not need to be closed
          explicitly. While it's not a problem to keep them around throughout
          a request, similar to the SqlSession, you might find that managing
          too many resources at this level will quickly get out of hand. Keep
          it simple, keep Mappers in the method scope. The following example
          demonstrates this practice.
        </p>
        
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">try (SqlSession session = sqlSessionFactory.openSession()) {
  BlogMapper mapper = session.getMapper(BlogMapper.class);
  // do work
}
